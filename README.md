## ❯ Why

Our main goal with this project is to simplify message sending across multiple transports.
We like you to be focused on your business and not spending time building notification services.

Try it!! We are happy to hear your feedback or any kind of new features.

We build off [W3Tecch's Express Typescript Boilerplate](https://github.com/w3tecch/express-typescript-boilerplate/)

## ❯ Getting Started

### Step 1: Set up the Development Environment

You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.

Install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- on OSX use [homebrew](http://brew.sh) `brew install node`
- on Windows use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) `choco install nodejs`

Install yarn globally

```bash
yarn global add yarn
```

### Step 2: Create new Project

Fork or download this project. Configure your package.json for your new project.

Then copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. In this file you have to add your database connection information.

Then setup your application environment.

```bash
yarn run setup
```

> This installs all dependencies with yarn. After that it migrates the database and seeds some test data into it. So after that your development environment is ready to use.

### Step 3: Serve your App

Go to the project dir and start your app with this yarn script.

```bash
yarn start serve
```

> This starts a local server using `nodemon`, which will watch for any file changes and will restart the server according to these changes.
> The server address will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000`.

## ❯ Scripts and Tasks

All script are defined in the `package-scripts.js` file, but the most important ones are listed here.

### Install

- Install all dependencies with `yarn install`

### Linting

- Run code quality analysis using `yarn start lint`. This runs tslint.
- There is also a vscode task for this called `lint`.

### Tests

- Run the unit tests using `yarn start test` (There is also a vscode task for this called `test`).
- Run the integration tests using `yarn start test.integration`.
- Run the e2e tests using `yarn start test.e2e`.

### Running in dev mode

- Run `yarn start serve` to start nodemon with ts-node, to serve the app.
- The server address will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000`

### Building the project and run it

- Run `yarn start build` to generated all JavaScript files from the TypeScript sources (There is also a vscode task for this called `build`).
- To start the builded app located in `dist` use `yarn start`.

## ❯ Debugger in VSCode

To debug your code run `yarn start build` or hit <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd> to build your app.
Then, just set a breakpoint and hit <kbd>F5</kbd> in your Visual Studio Code.

## ❯ API Routes

The route prefix is `/api` by default, but you can change this in the .env file.
The swagger and the monitor route can be altered in the `.env` file.

| Route          | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| **/api**       | Shows us the name, description and the version of the package.json |
| **/swagger**   | This is the Swagger UI with our API documentation |
| **/monitor**   | Shows a small monitor page for the server |

## ❯ Logging

Our logger is [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston). To log http request we use the express middleware [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan).
We created a simple annotation to inject the logger in your service (see example below).

```typescript
import { Logger, LoggerInterface } from '../../decorators/Logger';

@Service()
export class UserService {

    constructor(
        @Logger(__filename) private log: LoggerInterface
    ) { }

    ...
```

## ❯ Event Dispatching

We use this awesome repository [event-dispatch](https://github.com/pleerock/event-dispatch) for event dispatching.
We created a simple annotation to inject the EventDispatcher in your service (see example below). All events are listed in the `events.ts` file.

```typescript
import { events } from '../subscribers/events';
import { EventDispatcher, EventDispatcherInterface } from '../../decorators/EventDispatcher';

@Service()
export class UserService {

    constructor(
        @EventDispatcher() private eventDispatcher: EventDispatcherInterface
    ) { }

    public async create(user: User): Promise<User> {
        ...
        this.eventDispatcher.dispatch(events.user.created, newUser);
        ...
    }
```

## ❯ Docker

### Install Docker

Before you start, make sure you have a recent version of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) installed

### Build Docker image

```shell
docker build -t <your-image-name> .
```

### Run Docker image in container and map port

The port which runs your application inside Docker container is either configured as `PORT` property in your `.env` configuration file or passed to Docker container via environment variable `PORT`. Default port is `3000`.

#### Run image in detached mode

```shell
docker run -d -p <port-on-host>:<port-inside-docker-container> <your-image-name>
```

#### Run image in foreground mode

```shell
docker run -i -t -p <port-on-host>:<port-inside-docker-container> <your-image-name>
```

### Stop Docker container

#### Detached mode

```shell
docker stop <container-id>
```

You can get a list of all running Docker container and its ids by following command

```shell
docker images
```

#### Foreground mode

Go to console and press <CTRL> + C at any time.

### Docker environment variables

There are several options to configure your app inside a Docker container

#### project .env file

You can use `.env` file in project root folder which will be copied inside Docker image. If you want to change a property inside `.env` you have to rebuild your Docker image.

#### run options

You can also change app configuration by passing environment variables via `docker run` option `-e` or `--env`.

```shell
docker run --env DB_HOST=localhost -e DB_PORT=3306
```

#### environment file

Last but not least you can pass a config file to `docker run`.

```shell
docker run --env-file ./env.list
```

`env.list` example:
